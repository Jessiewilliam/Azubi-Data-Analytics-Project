## 🧠 Project Objectives
Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Understand the impact of various features (like job type, education, etc.) on campaign success.

Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.

Generate actionable insights for better targeting in future campaigns.

## 📌 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 41,188 records and 21 features, including:

Client attributes (age, job, marital status, education, etc.)

Last contact details of the campaign (contact duration, communication type)

Social and economic context (employment variation rate, consumer confidence, etc.)

Response variable: y (whether the client subscribed to a term deposit)

## 🔍 Key Insights
Identified which client demographics are more likely to subscribe.

Evaluated the importance of call duration and timing.

Analyzed how socio-economic factors affect campaign success.

Built a foundation for future machine learning modeling (optional extension).

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy – for data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – for data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – for interactive analysis

## 📈 Sample Visuals
The project includes:

Count plots for categorical features

Correlation heatmaps

Bar charts and histograms

Boxplots to explore numerical feature distributions

## 🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Jessiewilliam/Azubi-Data-Analytics-Project/tree/main
Open Azubi_Project_Bank_Analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE that supports .ipynb files.

Run the cells sequentially to explore the analysis.

## ✅ Recommendations
Target older clients with specific job categories.

Prioritize calls during months with higher response rates.

Minimize duration and optimize timing to reduce costs.
